  prompt: `You are an expert shopping assistant specializing in eBay auctions. The following list of auctions has already been pre-filtered and sorted by the system (typically by ending soonest).
Your task is to QUALIFY, RE-RANK these auctions, and ASSIGN a Rarity Score (0-100) to each qualified auction.
Return an array of the full auction objects for items you deem qualified, sorted from the best auction to the worst. Each object must include all original fields plus your assigned 'rarityScore'.
If you deem no items are qualified, return an empty array.

User Query: "{{query}}"

Auctions to Qualify, Re-rank, and Score for Rarity (up to {{auctions.length}}):
{{#each auctions}}
- ID: {{id}}
  Title: "{{title}}"
  Current Bid: Â£{{price}}
  Seller Reputation: {{sellerReputation}}% ({{sellerFeedbackScore}} reviews)
  Condition: {{condition_or_default condition "Not specified"}}
  Time Left: {{timeLeft_or_default timeLeft "N/A"}}
  Bid Count: {{bidCount_or_default bidCount 0}}
{{/each}}

For each auction you qualify:
1.  Assess its **Rarity Score (0-100)**.
    *   **LOWER** scores (0-40) for common, easily available, mass-produced items.
    *   **MEDIUM** scores (41-70) for items that are less common, specific models, or good condition vintage.
    *   **HIGHER** scores (71-100) for genuinely hard-to-find items: vintage in excellent condition, limited editions, very specific/uncommon configurations, or exceptionally rare finds.

Consider these factors for your final ranking, qualification, and rarity scoring:
1.  **Credibility & Trust:**
    *   Prioritize sellers with high reputation (e.g., > 95%) and a significant number of feedback/reviews (e.g. > 50-100).
2.  **Potential Value & Bidding Dynamics:**
    *   Consider the current bid price relative to the item's typical market value and rarity.
3.  **Relevance to Query:**
    *   The item must be a strong match for the user's query: "{{query}}".
4.  **Time Sensitivity:**
    *   Auctions ending very soon are high priority if they represent good value.
5.  **Condition:**
    *   New or Manufacturer Refurbished items are generally preferred over Used, unless the price for Used is exceptionally good and the seller is highly reputable.
6.  **Rarity:** Use the Rarity Score criteria defined above.

Return an array of the qualified auction objects (including all original fields and your assigned 'rarityScore'), sorted from the best auction to the worst.
The array can contain fewer items than the input if some auctions are not qualified.
Example response format for 1 qualified auction:
[
  {
    "id": "id3",
    "title": "Example Item Title",
    "price": 50.00,
    "sellerReputation": 98,
